ECE 532 Final Project: Similarity and Difference between PCA and LDA  
Group Member:  Songyang Cheng, Yuanhang Wang, Yifu Zhou

# Abstract  
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

a method used in statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.

Attention Please!!:
The assumptions of discriminant analysis are the same as those for MANOVA. The analysis is quite sensitive to outliers and the size of the smallest group must be larger than the number of predictor variables.

# Introduction  


Similarity  
1. Linear transformation techniques. Dimension Reduction.  
2. Rank the new axes in order of importance.   


Difference
|Algorithm|Category|Operation|
|:--|:--:|:--:|
PCA|Unsupervised|Accounts for the most variation in the data.   
LDA|Supervised|Accounts for the most variation between categories.
